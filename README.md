#### Using this template ####

This template sets you off in the right direction for your coursework. To get started:

* Run ```npm install``` from the project directory to install all the node packages.

* Run ```npm run build-db``` to create the database on Mac or Linux 
or run ```npm run build-db-win``` to create the database on Windows

* Run ```npm run start``` to start serving the web app (Access via http://localhost:3000)


NB. we will ONLY run ```npm install```, ```npm run build-db```, and ```npm run start``` . We will NOT install additional packages to run your code and will NOT run additional build scripts. Be careful with any additional node dependencies that you use.
